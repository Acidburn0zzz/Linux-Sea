  <title>Configuring a Linux Kernel</title>

  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>The Linux kernel is responsible for the majority of the hardware
    support. It contains the drivers to access and communicate with hardware.
    However, there are also quite some user-space tools required in order to
    succesfully work with the hardware. For instance, support for printing
    inside the kernel is limited to support to the LPT printer port or USB,
    but the printer drivers themselves are user-space.</para>

    <para>Another example are scanners: inside the kernel, you need either USB
    or SCSI support, but there are no drivers for scanners themselves. Those
    are available in the user-space.</para>

    <para>Terms like <emphasis>user-space</emphasis><indexterm>
        <primary>user-space</primary>
      </indexterm> (everything running as a regular process or data found in
    non-kernel-reserved memory) and
    <emphasis>kernel-space</emphasis><indexterm>
        <primary>kernel-space</primary>
      </indexterm> (in-kernel tasks or data in kernel-reserved memory) are not
    that frequently used in documentation about applications, but for drivers,
    the distinction is quite important. Everything in kernel-space can have
    quite an impact to performance (it must be fully tuned and proofread by
    various developers before it is accepted). As such, if particular drivers
    can be made part of a user-space design (this is not often possible) it is
    preferred to make them user-space drivers.</para>

    <para>To support all the hardware in your system well, you first need to
    identify what hardware is inside your system. Then, you need to find the
    correct configurations inside the Linux kernel that match against the
    hardware. Before building the Linux kernel, you also need to include
    support for the non-hardware related features you need (such as filesystem
    support). Once the kernel is built, you can store it to disk and update
    the boot loader to use the new kernel. Finally, you install and configure
    the user-space tools needed to deal with your hardware.</para>

    <title>Obtaining Hardware Information</title>

    <section>
      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>If you don't know what hardware is inside your system (and I'd be
      very surprised if you know all components, including vendor and type of
      your system) you will be glad to know Linux has quite some interesting
      tools to tell you what it found. The results of these tools are
      regardless of wether or not your kernel has support for these devices
      (although some small support is required, but most, if not all default
      kernels have this included).</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Device Information</title>

      <section>
        <title>Processor</title>

        <para>Information regarding the processor(s) in your system can be
        found inside the <filename>/proc/cpuinfo</filename><indexterm>
            <primary>cpuinfo</primary>
          </indexterm> file. This file is not a real file but a representation
        of what the Linux kernel finds in your system. In effect, every file
        in the <filename>/proc</filename> file system is a representation of
        the kernel's information and every time you read it it gives you the
        last known state.</para>

        <programlisting>$ <command>cat /proc/cpuinfo</command>
processor    : 0
vendor_id    : GenuineIntel
cpu family   : 6
model        : 13

               tm pbe nx est tm2
bogomips     : 1597.26
clflush size : 64</programlisting>

        <para>The information might overwhelm you - don't let it. The most
        interesting information here is the model name as it effectively tells
        you what brand and type of CPU this is. If you have multiple CPUs
        inside your system (or multiple cores) then you'll find multiple
        entries - one for each CPU / core.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Memory</title>

        <para>Similar to CPU information, you can view the information from
        the <filename>/proc/meminfo</filename><indexterm>
            <primary>meminfo</primary>
          </indexterm> file to obtain information regarding your memory. Or,
        you can use the <command>free</command> command to obtain the current
        memory usage statistics - including the total amount of memory your
        system has.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>PCI Devices</title>

        <para>PCI device information can be obtained using the
        <command>lspci</command><indexterm>
            <primary>lspci</primary>
          </indexterm> tool. Just entering <command>lspci</command> already
        gives you a nice overview of the PCI devices found inside your system.
        I recommend to use <command>lspci -k</command> as it will also display
        which kernel drivers are already used to manage the PCI device:</para>

    <title id="configuringkernel">Configuring a Linux Kernel</title>

    <para>There are two ways you can configure a Linux kernel in Gentoo Linux.
    One is the easiest method, yet not 100% reliable regarding supported
    hardware: it is a script Gentoo provides that builds a Linux kernel with a
    generic configuration and lots of loadable modules to include as much
    hardware support as possible. It works well for standard setups (both
    hardware and system setup) but might fail for more complex systems. The
    second method is the most reliable - you configure everything manually
    yourself. If it fails, it's most likely your own fault.</para>

    <para>But before we focus on these methods, a small introduction to the
    Linux kernel modules administration-wise.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Kernel Modules</title>

      <para>The Linux kernel is a file loaded into memory by the boot loader.
      However, Linux supports loadable kernel modules.</para>

      <para>A <emphasis>Linux kernel module</emphasis><indexterm>
          <primary>kernel module</primary>
        </indexterm><indexterm>
          <primary>linux kernel module</primary>

          <see>kernel module</see>
        </indexterm> is a part of the Linux kernel which can be dynamically
      loaded and unloaded from memory. As such, it is possible to build a
      kernel which supports certain hardware, but doesn't load support for
      these modules until absolutely necessary.</para>

      <para>Kernel modules are often used for detachable devices (such as USB
      devices) but also for distributions who want to provide a kernel to
      their users regardless of the hardware these users own: at bootup, the
      distribution will load the modules needed to support the hardware found
      and leave all other modules untouched.</para>

      <para>It is important to understand though that these modules are read
      from somewhere - you can't put the driver for your disk in a module and
      store that module on disk - the Linux kernel doesn't know what a disk is
      at that point and can therefor not find the module. Similar, don't put
      support for a particular file system (such as ext3) in a module and
      store that module on an ext3 file system.</para>

      <para>To be able to use kernel modules even though they might be
      required to access devices such as disks, you can create an intermediate
      root disk (<emphasis>initial root disk</emphasis><indexterm>
          <primary>initial root disk</primary>
        </indexterm> or <emphasis>initrd</emphasis><indexterm>
          <primary>initrd</primary>

          <see>initial root disk</see>
        </indexterm>). This contains the modules that might be needed in order
      to succesfully boot the system. Support for the initrd format is built
      in-kernel (in-kernel is the term denoting that support is not built as a
      kernel module but immediately made part of the Linux kernel image loaded
      by the boot loader).</para>

      <para>The boot loader itself is responsible for placing the initrd in
      memory and informing the Linux kernel where the initial root disk can be
      found.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Working with Modules</title>

        <para>The three most important commands to use for kernel modules
        manipulation are <command>lsmod</command>, <command>modprobe</command>
        and <command>rmmod</command>.</para>

        <para>To list the currently loaded modules, use
        <command>lsmod</command><indexterm>
            <primary>lsmod</primary>
          </indexterm>:</para>

        <para>The <command>lsmod</command> output gives you what modules are
        loaded, the size it takes in memory and how many/what other modules
        use it.</para>

        <para>To remove a loaded module, first ensure that the module is not
        used by any other module anymore (i.e. the "Used by" listing should be
        empty in the <command>lsmod</command> output) and then use
        <command>rmmod</command><indexterm>

          </indexterm>:</para>

        <programlisting># <command>rmmod ipw2200</command></programlisting>

        <para>If you want to load a module in memory, you should use
        <command>modprobe</command><footnote>
            <para>There is another command called insmod - this tool is less
            intelligent than modprobe: it only attempts to load a kernel
            module given its filename and it doesn't try to load the
            prerequirement modules (modules can prerequire other
            modules).</para>
          </footnote><indexterm>

      <title>Using Gentoo's genkernel Script</title>

      <para>Gentoo has a script called <command>genkernel</command><indexterm>
          <primary>genkernel</primary>
        </indexterm> which builds<indexterm>

          <secondary>configuring automatically</secondary>
        </indexterm> a complete Linux kernel based on some default
      configuration. Most hardware support is put in loadable modules although
      the configuration attempts to put all required device support
      in-kernel.</para>

      <para>To use genkernel, we first need to install it. As root, execute
      the following command (software installation is covered later in this
      book):</para>

      <programlisting># <command>emerge genkernel</command></programlisting>

      <para>The installation shouldn't take long. Once finished, run the
      genkernel tool with the all argument (this assumes that a Linux kernel
      source code is already installed - if Gentoo has been installed, this is
      already the case):</para>

      <programlisting># <command>genkernel all</command></programlisting>

      <para>Once finished, the script will have created the Linux kernel
      itself, the various modules and an initrd file containing the necessary
      modules that might be required to boot the system. The Linux kernel file
      and initial root disk are then used by the boot loader to boot up
      Linux.</para>

      <para>Simple, isn't it?</para>

      <title>Manually Configuring a Kernel</title>

      <para>Building a Linux kernel<indexterm>
          <primary>kernel</primary>

          <secondary>configuring manually</secondary>
        </indexterm> can take a while, but the majority of time comes in the
      configuration of the kernel. Especially the first Linux kernel
      configuration might even take over an hour to complete because there are
      so many options to select (or deselect). Luckily, configurations can be
      saved and reused later on, so subsequent configurations will be much
      faster.</para>

      <para>Even more, Pappy McFae, a vivid Gentoo user, is providing kernel
      seeds to Gentoo users. A <emphasis>kernel seed</emphasis><indexterm>
          <primary>kernel seed</primary>
        </indexterm> is, in his words:</para>

      <blockquote>
        <para>[a part of a kernel configuration where] all the tough stuff has
        already been set up. The basics for a standard desktop system
        configuration, basic network operation, and other settings have been
        set for stable systemic usability. All you, the user, have left to do
        is to plug in the required hardware devices, and you have a functional
        kernel.</para>
      </blockquote>

      <para>His idea is really worth persuing, so don't hesitate to take a
      look at <ulink
      url="http://www.kernel-seeds.org/">http://www.kernel-seeds.org/</ulink>.
      On the site, you can then navigate to your architecture (currently only
      x86 and x86_64 are supported), select the kernel tree you have installed
      (most likely gentoo if you have installed the gentoo-sources) and
      download the configuration file for the selected kernel version.</para>

      <para>Next, copy the configuration file to the kernel configuration
      location:</para>

      <programlisting># <command>cp /path/to/2.6.31-gentoo-r1-x86-07.config /usr/src/linux/.config</command></programlisting>

      <para>This will make sure that the kernel configuration utility uses the
      settings from the file as the "default".</para>

      <section>
        <title>Loading the Kernel Configuration Utility</title>

        <para>The Linux kernel provides its own configuration utility; if you
        go to the Linux source code and type in "make menuconfig" you'll be
        greeted with the index of the Linux kernel configuration:</para>

        <programlisting># <command>cd /usr/src/linux</command>
# <command>make menuconfig</command></programlisting>

        <note>
          <para>The visual representation (more specifically, the location of

        <para>This tool doesn't do much more than edit a configuration file
        called <filename>/usr/src/linux/.config</filename> so it will not
        reconfigure your current kernel setup. As such, I recommend you to try
        it out. If you want to be absolutely sure that you don't mess anything
        up, you can make a backup of the current configuration file prior to
        starting the menuconfig:</para>

        <programlisting># <command>cp .config .config~</command></programlisting>

        <para>A new feature, available from Linux 2.6.32 onwards, is the make
        option <command>localmodconfig</command><indexterm>
            <primary>localmodconfig</primary>
          </indexterm> (and a derivative called
        <command>localyesconfig</command><indexterm>
            <primary>localyesconfig</primary>
          </indexterm>). These options are interesting if you are currently
        running a LiveCD or different distribution with a default distribution
        kernel (a fits-all kernel that uses kernel modules) as they will
        enable the drivers that are currently loaded (when you execute the
        commands) in the kernel configuration, giving a nice configuration to
        start from. This is especially true with Pappy's kernel seeds
        ;-)</para>

        <programlisting># <command>make localmodconfig</command></programlisting>

        <para>The <command>localmodconfig</command> enables the drivers as
        kernel modules. The <command>localyesconfig</command> target enables
        the drivers as in-kernel selections (no modules).</para>

        <para>You should understand that your current Linux kernel (the one
        you're booted with) is stored elsewhere in the system (probably in
        <filename>/boot</filename>) and that this kernel doesn't need to know
        its configuration file anymore - it has been built using a particular
        configuration and will remain as-is.</para>

        <para>Configuring your own kernel is most likely a trial-and-error
        process: you configure a new kernel, boot it, play around and if
        you're not satisfied (or it doesn't boot at all), just reboot with the
        old kernel (having several kernels next to each other is not a
        problem).</para>

        <para>The menuconfig utility has an extensive help system built in.

CONFIG_MODULES:

Kernel modules are small pieces of compiled code which can
be inserted in the running kernel, rather than being
permanently built into the kernel. You use the "modprobe"
tool to add (and sometimes remove) them. If you say Y here,
many parts of the kenel can be built as modules (by 
answering M instead of Y where indicated): this is most
useful for infrequently used options which are not required
for booting. For more information, see the man pages for
modprobe, lsmod, modinfo, insmod and rmmod.

If you say Y here, you will need to run "make
modules_install" to put the modules under /lib/modules/
where modprobe can find them (you may need to be root to do
this).

If unsure, say Y.

        <para>As you can see, the system gives information about the selected
        option as well as an indication whether or not you should select this
        ("If unsure, say Y.").</para>

        <para>The system also has a search system. Press "/" and type in

        <para>The search results give you a one-liner explanation of the found
        results as well as where you can find the option (here: in the
        "General setup" tab). It also shows you when the option is selectable
        (when the configuration BROKEN is set, or when FRV is not selected -
        FRV is an architecture, just as x86 and SPARC are - so for a non-FRV
        architecture it is always selectable).</para>

              you're confident that you have enough memory (RAM) in your
              system for every possible situation. Swap space is used when
              free memory is needed but not available. In that case, the Linux
              kernel will move out old pages of memory (which are most likely
              not going to be used in the near future) to the swap
              space.</para>

              <para>Although definitely not mandatory for a kernel, building
              in .config support allows you to obtain the configuration for a
              running kernel from the kernel itself. This can come in handy if
              you don't keep track of the configurations you use(d) for
              kernels. You can, for instance, base a new kernel configuration
              on this configuration to get a good start.</para>

              <para>The subselection to support
              <filename>/proc/config.gz</filename> is an easy-to-use interface

              /proc/config.gz (for instance, <command>zcat /proc/config.gz
              &gt; /usr/src/linux/.config</command> and you have this kernel's

          <para>You also notice that initramfs support is not enabled: I'm no
          proponent of initrd's, it is in my opinion better that a user
          configures his kernel to his system rather than hoping that an

          depending on the system's use, a specific implementation can give a
          nice performance boost. The CFQ scheduler is a good implementation

              this case, many powerconsuming devices are shut down but you

              will detect this in the swap space and load all information back
              into memory so you can continue where you left off.</para>

              power consumption as it is a powerful technology. Sadly, not
              every device follows the ACPI guidelines strictly. You will find
              topics on the internet where boot failures or network
              irregularities can be solved by disabling a part of the ACPI

          yenta-compatible bridge.</para>

                <para>This driver allows me to create an interface which takes
                on all packets and just ignores them. This seems to be a weird
                driver, but it can come in handy from time to time. Also, this
                has no impact on my kernel size so I don't mind enabling this

    <title>Building a Linux Kernel</title>

    <para>Once your kernel configuration is finished, save the configuration
    (select 'Exit' and confirm that you want to save the new kernel
    configuration). Next, build the main kernel<indexterm>
        <primary>kernel</primary>

        <secondary>building</secondary>
      </indexterm> and the modules by entering the <command>make</command>
    command.</para>

    <programlisting>$ <command>make</command></programlisting>

    <para>The make command reads in a specific configuration file (the
    Makefile) which contains the instructions for building the Linux kernel
    completely. This can take a while; when finished, the kernel image will be
    stored in (for x86 architecture) <filename>arch/i386/boot</filename> and
    is called <filename>bzImage</filename><indexterm>
        <primary>bzImage</primary>
      </indexterm>.</para>

    <para>Next, you need to install the kernel modules (if any) on your
    system. Type in <command>make modules_install</command> to have the
    <command>make</command> command automatically copy the kernel modules to
    the correct location
    (<filename>/lib/modules/</filename><emphasis><filename>kernelversion</filename></emphasis>):</para>

    <programlisting># <command>make modules_install</command></programlisting>

    <para>Finally, copy over the kernel image to the /boot location. If /boot
    is a separate partition (as it is on my system) which isn't automatically
    mounted, mount it first:</para>

    <programlisting># <command>mount /boot</command>
# <command>cp /usr/src/linux/arch/x86/boot/bzImage /boot/kernel-2.6.25-r2</command></programlisting>

    <section>
      <title>Rebuilding a Kernel</title>

      <para>Suppose that you have succesfully built a kernel and are happily
      working with it. At some point in time, you'll need to upgrade your
      kernel. Luckily, there is no reason to perform the above steps over and
      over again.</para>

      <para>Go to the source location of your new kernel sources (most likely,
      still <filename>/usr/src/linux</filename>) and get your current kernel
      configuration. If you've followed the above configuration directives,
      you'll have access to these settings in
      <filename>/proc/config.gz</filename><indexterm>
          <primary>config.gz</primary>
        </indexterm>:</para>

      <programlisting># <command>cd /usr/src/linux</command>
# <command>zcat /proc/config.gz &gt; .config</command></programlisting>

      <para>The <command>zcat</command> command will "load" your current
      kernel configuration into the <filename>.config</filename> file, which
      is the file used by the kernel building process to find the (new)
      configuration settings. Next, tell the kernel build tool to use this
      configuration as if it is your old(er) configuration. This will result
      in the build process to only ask for validation when new configuration
      items are found (in the new sources) that weren't available
      previously.</para>

      <programlisting># <command>make oldconfig</command></programlisting>

      <para>When this is finished, continue with the <command>make</command>
      and <command>make modules_install</command> commands, finishing off with
      the <command>mount</command> and copy commands to install the new kernel
      at the <filename>/boot</filename> location.</para>

      /boot</command>). If I now reboot my system, I am booted with the new
      Linux kernel (at least if everything works). If for some reason the
      kernel doesn't work, I can restart the system and select the second
      entry in the menu to boot the old kernel (which I know works) and
      attempt to fix the configuration.</para>

    <title>Troubleshooting Boot Failures</title>

    <para>One of the worst issues you can face is an unbootable system. Yes,
    it is bad, because without being able to boot, how can you fix the system
    (or debug / troubleshoot)? Before continuing with the most frequent boot
    failures (and how to deal with them), first a quick look at how to
    generally act when a system fails to boot...</para>

    <section>
      <title>When a system fails to boot...</title>

      <para>A boot failure can either be due to:</para>

        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>It's pretty easy to guess which one is the hardest to detect but
      easiest to resolve (hint: it's the hardware malfunction one). The other
      ones, well, they require a bit preparation in order to easily
      troubleshoot and, eventually, solve.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Rescue Kernel Boot Entry</title>

        <para>Whenever you have a kernel that boots (regardless of the fact
        that the kernel doesn't support your sound card or doesn't play 3D
        action games well), make a new entry in your boot loader to boot this
        kernel:</para>

        boot the backup (rescue) kernel and retry configuring your
        kernel.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Kernel Parameters</title>

        <para>GRUB allows you to boot a kernel / system with a modified set of
        parameters for a single time (i.e. the changes are not persisted).
        This allows you to (re)boot a kernel with additional
        parameters.</para>

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>When you are at the GRUB screen, highlight the entry you
            want to boot, and press <command>e</command> (for edit).</para>

          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Edit the line accordingly (a kernel parameter is often a
            word or key=value set appended to the line), and press Enter to
            save the changes (remember, it is just for this single
            boot)</para>

        helped with one or more kernel parameters being added.</para>

        <title>Rescue Live Linux Environment</title>

        <para>If a system fails to boot due to a system configuration issue, I
        recommend to boot from a rescue environment (<ulink
        url="http://www.sysresccd.org">SysRescCD</ulink> comes to mind). Since
        USB sticks are widely spread and easy to work with, I suggest that you
        configure your system to be able to boot from USB <emphasis>and test
        it</emphasis>. It is faster than booting from most CD/DVD drives
        (sorry, I still don't have a BlueRay drive at the time of writing) and
        a rescue USB stick is easier to carry with you.</para>

        <para>Having a rescue live Linux environment around you is really
        worth it. Configuration failures are easily made, and can have serious
        consequences. Gentoo Linux doesn't have a roll-back scenario (yet)
        that allows you to boot with previous settings.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Kernel Boot Failures</title>

      <para>Kernel boot failures can have multiple causes, but usually the
      output on the screen allows you to identify the issue rapidly.</para>

      <section>
        <title>ACPI Issues</title>

        <para>ACPI is a common source of boot failures. It isn't that the
        (ACPI) standard is bad, or that Linux drivers often implement it
        wrongly. Rather, some hardware is known not to follow the ACPI
        standard to the letter, making it difficult to write drivers that
        comply to the ACPI standard with this hardware.</para>

        <para>Issues with ACPI support are often seen through kernel oops
        messages (which is a dump to the screen offering information for
        kernel developers regarding the problem) that point to
        <function>acpi_*</function> functions:</para>

        <programlisting><emphasis>[     0.873537]  [&lt;ffffffff8134ecba&gt;] ? acpi_video_register+0x3f/0x71</emphasis>

[     0.876832]  [&lt;ffffffff8100c360&gt;] ? child_rip+0x0/0x20</programlisting>

        <para>Whenever you suspect that ACPI is the source of your issue, boot
        the same kernel, but with the <parameter>noacpi</parameter><indexterm>
            <primary>noacpi</primary>
          </indexterm> parameter.</para>

        <title>Unable to mount root-fs</title>

        <para>Most likely one of the most occurring issue (but once you solved
        it, you most likely are never going to see it again):</para>

        <programlisting>Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)</programlisting>

        <para>or</para>

        <programlisting>VFS: Cannot open root device "sda3" or unknown-block(8,3)
Please append a correct "root=" boot option; here are the available partitions:
  sda driver: sd
    sda1 sda2</programlisting>

        <para>The digits "0,0" or "8,3" can be different in your case - it
        refers to the device that the kernel tries to access (and which
        fails). Generally speaking one can say that, if the first digit is 0,
        then the kernel is unable to identify the hardware. If it is another
        digit (like 8), it is unable to identify the file system (but is able
        to access the hardware).</para>

        <para>The problem here is that the kernel that you are booting cannot
        translate the "root=/dev/..." parameter you gave it (inside the boot
        loader configuration) into a real, accessible file system. Several
        reasons can result in such a failure:</para>

            <para>One of the most frequent cases: you selected support for
            your harddisk controller protocol (IDE, SATA, SCSI, ...) but
            forgot to select the HDD controller driver itself (like Intel

            <para>This isn't as stupid as it sounds. When you are booted with
            one kernel, it might list your disks as being /dev/sda whereas
            your (configured) kernel is expecting it to be /dev/hda. This is
            not because kernels are inconsistent with each other, but because
            of the drivers used: older drivers use the hda syntax, newer
            sda.</para>

            <para>Also, recent kernels give an overview of the partitions they

            if you misselected a partition (in the example given at the
            beginning of this section, only two partitions are found whereas
            the kernel was instructed to boot the third). If it doesn't, it is
            most likely because the kernel doesn't know the device to begin
            with (so it can't attempt to display partitions).</para>

            new one. As a result, they copy the kernel to the root file system

      <title>System Boot Failures</title>

      <para>The following set of subsections explain various failures you
      might get in contact with. These failures are less (or not) related with
      the kernel build process, but since they occur at boot-time (and due to
      lack of a better location in this book) I've included them in this
      chapter...</para>

        <title>X (graphical environment) comes up, but keyboard or mouse
        doesn't work</title>

        <para>You might have this issue when you have just upgraded your
        graphical environment or HAL process. By itself not a very easy thing
        to debug, but you'll need to get access to your system, and rebooting
        doesn't help (as you'll get into the same situation anyhow).</para>

        <para>Luckily, you can ask Gentoo to boot the system without starting
        the graphical environment (leaving you with the command-line login
        from which you can fix things). Reboot until you get into the GRUB
        menu. Then press e(dit) on the boot item, e(dit) again on the kernel
        line, and add "nox" at the end of the line. This option will inform
        Gentoo not to load X.</para>

        <para>Now that you are booted without the graphical environment, you
        can fix your system.</para>

        <para>One reason this might happen is that X has been upgraded but you
        need to rebuild the various xf86-input-* packages. To get the list of
        installed xf86-input-* packages, you can use qlist:</para>

        <programlisting># <command>qlist -I xf86-input</command>
x11-drivers/xf86-input-evdev
x11-drivers/xf86-input-keyboard
x11-drivers/xf86-input-mouse
x11-drivers/xf86-input-synaptics</programlisting>

        <para>You can reinstall those packages using the following
        command:</para>

        <programlisting># <command>emerge -1 `qlist -CI xf86-input`</command></programlisting>

        <para>Mind the use of the ` character at both beginning and ending of
        the <command>qlist</command> stanza.</para>
