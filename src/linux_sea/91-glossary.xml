        <para>Reduced Instruction Set Computing, a CPU instruction design that
        attempts to offer a simple list of instructions to use by software
        engineers. By limiting the complexity of the instructions, RISC CPUs
        can be made faster than more complex CPUs clockwize.</para>

      <glossdef>
        <para>Complex Instruction Set Computing, a CPU instruction design that
        attempts to offer a large list of powerful CPU instructions to use by
        software engineers. The powerful instructions allow engineers to
        perform complex tasks with a minimum on instructions. The CPU is
        optimized to perform these instructions faster than most software
        implementations on RISC CPUs.</para>
